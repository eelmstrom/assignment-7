# Package title
ggplot2

# Location
You can install this package from Cran or GitHub. That said, ggplot2 is part of the larger package “tidyverse” so the easiest way to install this package is to just install tidyverse itself.

# Vignette(s)
Does the package have any formal vignettes, or just the standard collection of help files? If there are one or more vignettes, what topics do they cover?

Yes! This package does have formal vignettes. One talks about using ggplot in packages. Another explains aesthetic specification.

# Application(s)
Are there any applications of the package, as demonstrated on a website like we built, someone’s blog, Twitter post, etc?

There are many many applications of ggplot2. Karen Woo’s website is a good example.

# Review

Write a short (<300 words) review of the package. What is the primary purpose of the package (eg, is used for plotting, reading or scraping data, manipulating data, statistical modeling, etc)? What are the things you like about the package? Are there things you don’t like or wish it did differently? Was the package easy to learn how to use? Would you recommend this package to someone else?

The primary purpose of this package is to plot data and create beautiful graphics. I truly appreciate this package! It has made my graphic creation so much easier. It has especially helped me to visualize large datasets with many different variables and sites specifics. Specifying colors or lines by groups is done by just a few lines of code. You can easily arrange graphics together in a multi-plot, something that would have taken me hours before. And because it is such a well-used package you can almost always figure out what to do using the resources online. I think I owe the past four years of my life to this package. That sounds sad… But seriously since I’ve learned to code in R, making plots with ggplot has made my life better!
The only thing I have not figured out/don’t really like is that you can’t set the specific scale on a second axis of a plot. I think eventually I will figure this out!
